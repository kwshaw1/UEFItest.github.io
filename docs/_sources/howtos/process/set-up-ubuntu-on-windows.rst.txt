Set up Ubuntu on Windows for Sphinx development
###################################################

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and configuring
everything you need to be productive with git and Sphinx publishing using
OTC-TCS workflows.

Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux
***************************************

#. Open a powershell terminal with administrative privileges and run the
   following command:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

#. Click the link to open the Microsoft store and get the Ubuntu
   disro: https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6

#. Launch the Ubuntu app from the start menu and follow the prompts to
   create your user account

Configure your Ubuntu distro for the proxy
******************************************

#. ~/.bashrc gets run everytime you log in to a terminal, so we need to add
   the following lines to the end of it:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export http_proxy=http://proxy-chain.intel.com:911
      export https_proxy=http://proxy-chain.intel.com:912

#. APT is the package management software for Ubuntu. We need to create
   /etc/apt/apt.conf and add the following line to get it to work:

   .. code-block:: bash

      Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy-chain.intel.com:911";

#. SSH needs to know to use the proxy for github access, so we need to add
   the following lines to ~/.ssh/config:

   .. code-block:: bash

      host github.com
      port 22
      user git
      ProxyCommand nc -x proxy-us.intel.com:1080 %h %p

#. I needed to update permissions on the .ssh/config file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
      chown $USER ~/.ssh/config

Set up your ssh key
*******************

#. From the terminal run the following command, and use the default prompts
   (having a passphrase is recommended):

   .. code-block:: bash

      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

   Output will reflect your environment but be similar to:

   .. code-block:: console

      Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
      Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

#. Now you'll need to copy the public key to github. Instructions for that
   are here: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/

Install dependencies
********************

#. We need to get APT up to date before we start adding software
   packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt update

#. Some packages that might be useful for documentation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install doxygen graphviz default-jre

#. Python3 should be installed, so now we just need to install pip:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt -y install python3-pip

#. Create a file called requirements.txt and add the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      breathe==4.9.1
      sphinx==1.7.5
      docutils==0.14
      sphinx_rtd_theme
      sphinxcontrib-plantuml

#. Run the following command from the terminal to install the above Python
   modules for Sphinx development:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip3 install -r requirements.txt


Some Rules
**********

#. If you want to use a Windows GUI editor (Sublime, for example), then
   files must be stored on the Windows partition. Files located on your
   Windows filesystem can be found from the Linux partition here:

   .. code-block:: bash

      /mnt/c/rest/of/path

   A downside to this is that paths become quite long. You can workaround
   this by creating a symlink in your Ubuntu home directory: 

   .. code-block:: bash

      ln -s /mnt/c/path/to/your/git_repos ~/work_dir

   And it can be used like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd work_dir

   .. note:: 

      This is important because you must never edit files in the Linux
      partition from Windows: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2016/11/17/do-not-change-linux-files-using-windows-apps-and-tools/
